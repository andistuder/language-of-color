%h2 Scope
%p
  The purpose of the AIC Study Group on the Language of Colour (SGLC) is to share information on and discuss studies on psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, semantics and semiotics of colour names and relation of these to cognitive (neuro)science of colour perception. Key topics are colour cognition, colour naming, categorisation, colour memory, colour semantics and semiotics, cross-cultural differences and their intersection with digital technologies.
%p
  We communicate with our members through newsletters (via email), our website and social network platforms in Twitter (@aic_lc) and Facebook (@languageofcolour). We host regular meetings for our members at AIC conferences and events.

%p
  Galina obtained her PhD (General Psychology) from Moscow Lomonosov State University (Russia) and Dr. habil./Venia legendi (Cognitive Neuroscience) from Ruhr-University Bochum (Germany). Her main research interest is in Colour Vision and Colour Cognition. Currently she is Professor of Psychology at Liver­pool Hope University (UK). In Colour Cognition, she studies language-specific colour categorisation, in particular, colour naming in Russian and Italian and, as well, in bilinguals (German-English, Italian-English and Mandarin Chinese-Eng­lish).
%p
  In 2005-06 she was part of a nine-language project Colour Around the Baltic Sea. She co-edited a book Anthropology of Color: Interdisciplinary Multilevel Mod­eling (Amsterdam: John Benjamins; 2007) whose focus is on the role of social and cultural constraints on evolution and structure of colour categories. From 2008 Galina is a member of The Colour Group (Great Britain); in 2010-12 she was a member of the CGGB Executive Committee. She co-organised several annual Vision Meetings of the CGGB: in 2010 (London), 2012 (Cambridge) and 2015 (London). In 2013 Galina was a keynote speaker at the Colour Language and Colour Categorization conference in Tallinn (Estonia).
